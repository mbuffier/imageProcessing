# Image Processing
Image processing algorithms, including non-local mean, poisson editing and various segmentation functions (region growing, mean-shift)

Here are some of my most interresting image processing algorithms : 

# Segmentation
Implementation of a region growing algorithm and implementation of mean-shift

# Non-local mean filter
Implementation of template matching, integral images and denoising an image using non local mean filter

# Poisson editing
A poisson editing algorithm computed both by importing gradient und by use of the existing gradient 
Implementation of an application to do color editing
