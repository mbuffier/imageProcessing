# Image Processing
Image processing algorithms, including non-local mean, poisson editing and various segmentation functions (region growing, mean-shift)

Here are some of my most interresting image processing algorithms : 

## Segmentation
Implementation of a region growing algorithm
Implementation of the mean-shift algorithm

## Non-local mean filter
Implementation of a non-local mean filter to denoise images using template matching and integral images 

## Poisson editing
A poisson editing algorithm computed by 
- importing gradient from an other image  
- use of the existing gradient 

Implementation of an application to do color editing
