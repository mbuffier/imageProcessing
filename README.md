# imageProcessing
Image processing algorithms, including non-local mean, poisson editing and various segmentation function (region growing, mean-shift)

Here are some of my most interresting image processing algorithms : 

Segmentation : region growing algorithm, mean-shift
Non-local mean : implementation of template matching and denoising using non local mean 
In poisson editing : a poisson editing algorithm both by importing gradient und use of existing gradient
